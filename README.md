 # Fintech and Real Estate
## Overview  and Origin

### Name of the company?
The company that I have chosen for this project, is a fintech based real estate investment firm, Cadre. Cadre, is Fintech based Real Estate investment firm, located in New York. This company mainly focuses on commercial real estate investment, particularly office, hospitality and multi-residential properties. Cadre is the very first commercial real estate investment firm which has used financial technology-based platform, to fully automated the investors experience.

### When was the company incorporated?

Cadre was incorporated in 2014, in New York, United States. 

### Who are the founders of the company?

The primary founders are Ryan Williams (CEO and cofounder), as well as the Kushner brothers, Jarrod and Joshua Kushner. 

### How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?
<br>
Ryan Williams has been involved with real estate investment since the early university days at Harvard. At the age of 24, Williams started by buying distressed properties in the outskirts of Atlanta. After graduation he went on to work for some major investment firms such as Goldman Sachs and Blackstone. After some years he quickly realized that his real estate company was doing very well. However, as the pandemic hit, Cadres revenues dropped drastically. Thus, to move forward, Cadre, had to scale back on staff, by letting go of 1/3 of the cadre employees and 100 operating staff. He quickly learned that majority of the work, which was done by individuals now can be automated, hence saving on cost across the board. Through technology, Cadre, has been able to continue to build towards there mission, which is to “create a leveling filed in an industry that is often tilted towards the big players, with a minimum investment of $50,000 vs other private investment firms such as Goldman Sachs which is at a minimum of $250,000. 

<br>

### How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?

<br>

Cadre has gone through two stages of funding totaling to $400 million. This funding has come through various major firms such as Goldman Sachs, Ford foundation, Anderseen Horwitz, SL Green Realty and as well as Founders Fund and General Catalysts. According to an interview article published by Forbes, Now, Williams is back on the offensive, launching a new $400 million real estate fund oriented to individual investors, financial advisors, and institutions. The Cadre Direct Access Fund is an attempt by Williams to push Cadre’s real estate technology investment platform closer to smaller investors and advisors looking to invest directly in real estate deals at reasonable costs but maintain good liquidity.

<br>

In an article published by PENTA, explains, how Cadre thus far has closed on a number of opportunities for the fund. Half of these transactions where within the residential sector by focusing on multi-residential, due to lack of housing especially in growth markets.  The second half of the fund is geared largely to industrial development, with probable Hotel Investment, which depends mainly on the rate and pace of return. We will be opportunistic in terms of how we look at those deals,” William says. 

## Business Activities:
<br>

### What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?
<br>

Real Estate, as an industry, has always been very traditional and with a few changes to its infrastructure through out the years. As years have gone by technology as evolved within the financial sector. Since the emergence of fintech many organizations and industries have shifted their focus on fintech and its role within today’s major financial establishments. This is the same now for real estate. In real estate there has always been problems around transparency and fees. During the interview with PENTA, Williams explains how Cadres has been able to scale back on fees which is not the case with their private counterparts. Williams goes to say “Unlike a traditional private-equity real estate fund, which charges two levels of fees at the fund company level and the real-estate operating company level Cadre can cut out the fund level fees because it has automated many of the firm’s processes. He then breaks down the fees that are charged by Cadre. Investors pay an annual management fee of 1.5%, an administration fee of 0.5% a year for those with up to US$1 million in assets invested (those with assets between US$1 million and US$10 million invested pay 0.25%), and a one-time commitment fee of 3.5% that is reduced for higher levels of assets invested, says Williams. through this strategy and technology Cadre has been able to provide much more level investing environment and opportunities for all its investors.  

<br>

Recently Cadre introduced a secondary Market. In a nutshell a secondary market, provides an opportunity for existing and a chance for a new accredit investor to buy in. according to Cadre, "The Cadre Secondary Market matches interested buyers of commercial real estate with sellers looking to exit their positions. For existing investors, a secondary sale may offer opportunities to liquidate earlier than the usual CRE investment timeline. The secondary market is currently available to accredited investors seeking access to Cadre’s deal-by-deal investment platform, and is expected to eventually be available to trade shares of the Cadre Direct Access Fund. While liquidity is based on marketplace dynamics and is not guaranteed, our goal is to democratize access to the asset class by making opportunities for liquidity available to a greater number of investors. All investors are encouraged to review the offering materials when making an investment for specifics on how the marketplace operates."

<br>

This in turn creates further opportunities for investors to get into an existing deals which are no longer available. This makes Cadre the very first firm to leverage technology in order to provide a fully automated buy and sell model, that will provide liquidation of your current stake in the investment, in a short period of time such as buying and selling stocks.   

<br>

### Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers? What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?) 

<br>

The commercial real estate investment industry is a staggering $16 trillion dollar industry, within united states alone. However, this has been mostly available to the higher tier and bigger players. Cadre has been able to modify that spectrum’, and has provided equal level across the board, so that smaller investors can as well have a piece of a thriving commercial real estate investment. With the assistance of technology, Cadre has been able to position itself as much more attractive investment firm by providing and creating investment opportunities via lower capital requirements with only a few clicks.  

<br>

By introducing financial technology, they have been able to scale back many fees within real estate transaction and investment. They provide transparency and security. Lesser minimum investing capital, thus making more attractive to small to medium size investors. 

<br>

What sets Cadre apart from its counter parts, it is the introduction of the secondary market. As mentioned previously, the secondary market acts as buy and sell platform, which is fully automated. Thus, allowing current investors to liquidate their stake and to allow other investors to get in on earlier deals. Through this Cadre has provided the environment of trade within real estate, similar to trading stock or shares of a company. In the past with major REIT's, investors were only able to invest in shares and stocks of the REIT itself, as oppose to having direct ownership and stake within the real estate investment itself. Thus, making Cadre a game changer within the industry. 

<br>

Cadre has been able to establish itself with some of the largest firms from earlier on. Cadre spent the first couple of years by establishing a solid team. Ryan Williams, CEO of Cadre, in his previous days was able to create and maintain relationships, with high executives at Goldman Sachs and Blackstone. These were firms that Ryan Williams was previously employed by. This provided Cadre with a major advantage and leap, as majority of Cadres board and team members are from highly stablished investment firms such as Goldman Sachs and Blackstone. By building a world class team, Cadre was able to lock its first round of invest of $250 million, from Goldman Sachs. Thus, creating a far more advantage than some of their competitors that had to use other forms of pulling investments such as crowed funding, which can take much longer.

<br>

Another advantage that Cadre has over their competitors, its Ryan’s cofounders, the Kushner brothers, Jarrod and Joshua Kushner. The partnership with the Kushner brothers from earlier on, validated Cadre as major opportunity withing in the real estate realm. Kushner was an early Cadre investor. He owns a stake in the firm worth up to $50 million, according to Kushner's 2018 federal financial disclosure form. Also Thrive Capital, a venture firm owned by Joshua Kushner, was another early backer. Williams, in an interview with CNN Business Insider, goes to say, "Jared was one of the key people early on. And his contributions were critical,". Thus, providing Cadre with the jump start advantage, over their competitors.

<br>

### Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them?

<br>

Since 2019 and the emergence of the pandemic, Cadre, took a whole different turn. Cadre, quickly understood, that in order to be able to survive and prosper, Cadre would have to introduce major changes to the establishment’s infrastructure. This change came upon the further establishment of new technology. Thus, replacing about one third of the companies’ employees. Cadre, recognized that through a technology approach and as well as developing and the implementation of proprietary technology, will provide and increase real estate access. Accurate feed back and assurance on market selections, seamless acquisition of assets, optimizing asset management, scaling fund feature, and efficiencies savings on quality assets.

<br>


For private investor, information and data regarding the particular real estate investment, is key. However, this not the case for every real estate opportunity out there. More than so, would be due diligence process for vetting specific real estate investment opportunities can be overly opaque. However, Cadre integrates technology in every aspect of the business, so that investors can gain access to commercial real estate in much more efficient and transparent way.


<br>

Market selection at Cadre, at its core its driven with technology. Cadre's inhouse data-scientist, tend to select markets, which is believed that to outperform in the next few years. Cadres buying recommendation are backed and confirmed via their data scientist who uses analytics to understand insights on market trends using the following two proprietary models such as pricing and growth model.

<br>

The pricing model, it is structured, that it tracks market appreciation across various geographical areas, and asset classes. Were on the other hand the growth model, forecasts potential asset growth over a two-year horizon, takes into consideration 40,000 variables and 3 million data points (including population growth, employment trends, rent growth, new construction and occupancy), and lastly Uses machine learning to disentangle the many drivers of market appreciation.

<br>

Cadre, through proprietary technology has been able to develop and implement a much more efficient content management system. By aggregating third party macro information about the property and its financial information, in order to standardize the data. Thus, making the analyst decision making process more accurate and at a faster rate. Through collection and aggerating of data, the system can turn over better investment decisions. Therefor creating tools within the system, which eliminates hiring further professionals to do what the system does in a fraction of time. Thus far, Cadre has been able to identify 15 real estate markets across the nation with high potential in growth.

<br>

Through the underwriting process, cadre has the ability to understand and determine if the asking price of an asset matches its appraisal value. This information helps Cadre and its acquisition professionals if this will be a good deal. Thus, shifting the traditional way of acquisition, to a more automated and fully digitized. Thus, the use of proprietary technology helps Cadre to acquire assets faster and smarter:

<br>

*   Make investment decisions quickly, helping us to compete for assets
*   They can underwrite more deals per person, which cuts down on human capital
*   Reliable data is easily accessible, leading to more informed decisions
*   The property “scores” are objective, helping to remove individual bias from the process

Once the acquisition has been completed, Cadres team. starts the managing process the investors. In order for Cadre to achieve that, Cadre developed an automated workflow software that assist to optimize all of our assets under management. According to cadre Our technology helps us track in near real-time the performance of each property against its business plan. Automating this part of the management process allows our on-the-ground operators to more efficiently detail and validate property-level data, while reducing the chances of input and analytical error. Additionally, such in-depth views of our assets’ performance allow us to adapt to changing market trends at a faster pace than traditional asset managers.

Cadre’s technology helps us save team resources and improve investor reporting:

Significant Time Savings

*   Automation saves about 12 hours per deal each reporting period
*   API integrations reduce input error by eliminating the need for manual data submissions

<br>
Enhanced Reporting

<br>

*   Leases and rent rolls are updated daily (general practice is to update monthly)
*   Portfolio reporting and analytics are updated daily (general practice is to update quarterly)
*   Automated monthly data checks help ensure accuracy


Cadre’s technology not only helps to select, acquire and manage assets, it also assists to scale all aspects of fund operations: capital calls, distributions, regulatory reporting, and tax preparation. Cadre investors have prompt access to the investment management process through Cadre's platform, so they can make informed investment decisions.

Cadre’s technological advances and ongoing enhancements allow them to automate and streamline core business functions. This, in turn, can help to reduce our overhead for the provision and management of institutional-quality assets. These savings can be passed on to our investors.

Cadres, automation efforts since July 2020 reflect the following improvements in workflow efficiency:

*   4 hours saved per distribution
*   3 hours saved per deal fees calculations
*   3 hours saved per report generated
*   30+ min saved per secondary / transfer transaction
*   50+ different workflow automation services working in tandem to increase overall efficiency.

Ever since its inception, Cadre, has had the vision, to ease the process of real estate investment and hence to bring it to the forefront via the use of technology. This vision very much became a reality during the pandemic, in contrary to its timing. Even though revenues dropped, this became a turning point in Cadres organization. Through introduction of financial technology such machine learning and proprietary model. Through these systems, Cadre has been able to largen the pull of investors by leveling the field and brining investments minimums below $50,000. Thus, creating opportunities for all.

<br>

## Results

### What has been the business impact of this company so far?

<br>

One component that sets Cadre aside from its counter parts is responsible investing. Cadre has been able to successfully attain this through capital and investment. In an interview with Abby Shultz, a columnist for PENTA, William says “Leveraging our [operating] partner ecosystem and network is one of the best ways to invest in those who are underserved and marginalized. Real estate operators and developers can create wealth through their operations, but these companies don’t tend to have a lot of gender or ethnic diversity”. 

<br>

Cadres impact reaches as far as partnering with minority and women operators and bringing MDIs into its financing groups. The focus here remains on investing in properties that provide a “clear positive impact on communities we invest in. That may mean partnering with non-profits to provide financial literacy or afterschool programs in multi-family housing structures, to “making sure from an affordability perspective and attainable housing perspective, we’re being responsible and prudent,” Williams says to Shultz. 

<br>

### What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?

<br>

Within every industry or corporation, there are certain core metrics which allows a company to prosper and succeed in their given domain and industry. Within fintech some key metrics for success is to provide better productivity through automating finance processes – cheaper, faster, and more accurate
More informed decision-making, Meeting the expectations of customers, regulators, and investors, and as well as Maximizing valuations, through enhanced trust, credibility, and better decision-making. 
 
<br>

Cadre has modeled its organization and platform very much after these core metrics. Through propriety models and machine learning, Cadres has made end-user experience is very much automated, end to end. Through implementation of technology, they have been able to make decision times faster and efficient for acquisition team, the underwriting team and as well as the investors them selves. In addition, the introduction of the secondary market, is a testament to Cadres efforts to provide opportunities across the board. Thus, giving their investors the opportunity to trade real estate in real time, at fraction of the fees and the ability to have direct ownership within a thriving commercial investment with double digit annual return.

<br>

### How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?

<br>

According to Forbes, Fintech 50 report, Cadre currently sits third highest valuation, at a staggering $800 million. Which is impressive growth for such a young company. However, according to fintechmagazine.com, Cadre sits at number 8 of top 10 fintech real estate investment companies globally. They have since 2020 maintained a 96% rent collection and with only 1% of tenants moved out. Cadre is first of its kind to use technology efficient, to provide such investment opportunities to the masses and not just the elite.

<br>

## Recommendations
<br>

### If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)

<br>

If I was going to advise of a service, I would focus on their secondary market. To futher develop the this sector, I would suggest in aquistion of smaller investment properties to be added such as single family homes. with the high need for rental propeties in many markets, individuals can own 100% stake in the investment and to have Cadre to manage the asset as  single rental property, in adition to their multi family properties. This can help both the underserved by providing single family housing and an opportunity to own 100% stake of their asset, as well as the ability to trade their full stake withing Cadres new and exisiting investors.  

<br>

### Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?

I believe this wil futher their horizon within the investment sector, as it will broaden their pool of investors, and ultimatley providing housing for thoes unable to puchase and aquire. 
<br>

### What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?

I bleive the exiisting technology with Cadre would be suffitient, such propietry model and machine learning. 
<br>

### Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?

In order to acces and pull the data required, propietry models can assist with that, and in order to fully automate the service, machine learning would be at its core.
